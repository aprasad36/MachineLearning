This is a neural network made from scratch.

I'm going to write it in Java because I'm an idiot.

Tester is for testing specific methods. The actual program runs from Net or NeuralNet. This repository will require the user to compile the code by themselves by running the following commands in terminal:
```
javac NeuralNet.java
java NeuralNet
```
or
```
javac Net.java
java Net
```
